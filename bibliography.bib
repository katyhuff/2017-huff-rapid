	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {Thermal diffusivity measurements of seven igneous rocks were made to temperatures of 400°C and pressures of 200 MPa. The measuring method was based on the concept of cylindrical symmetry and periodic heat pulses. The seven rocks measured were Westerly (Rhode Island) granite, Climax Stock (Nevada) quartz monzonite, Pomona (Washington) basalt, Atikokan (Ontario, Canada) granite, Creighton (Ontario, Canada) gabbro, East Bull Lake (Ontario, Canada) gabbro, and Stripa (Sweden) granite. The diffusivity of all the rocks showed a positive linear dependence on inverse temperature and, excluding the East Bull Lake gabbro, showed a linear dependence on quartz content. (Quartz content varied from 0 to 31\% by volume.) Diffusivity in all cases rose or remained steady with increasing confining pressure. The pressure effect was strongest at lowest pressures and vanished by levels between 10 and 100 MPa, depending on rock type. The pressure effect (measured as a percentage change in diffusivity) is stronger in the four rocks of granitic composition than in the three of basaltic composition. Our results agree well with existing thermal diffusivity measurements at atmospheric pressure.},

By this time 5500 thm of vitrified high level waste will have accumulated. Both types of waste will be finally disposed of in one underground repository. Potential host rocks are rock salt, granite and mudrock. Up to now several performance assessment studies have been carried out in order to identify the main parameters governing the long-term safety of such repositories. The disposal concepts investigated differ widely in the water content of the rock formations, the engineered barrier systems and the sorption capacities of the various materials.

	abstract = {Fuel cycle scenario analysis codes are valuable tools for investigating the effects of various decisions on the performance of the nuclear fuel cycle as a whole. Until recently, repository metrics in such codes were based on mass and were independent of the isotopic composition of the waste. A methodology has been developed for determining peak repository loading for an arbitrary set of isotopics based on the heat load restrictions and current geometry specifications for the Yucca Mountain repository. This model was implemented in the VISION fuel cycle scenario analysis code and is used here to study the effects of separation efficiencies on repository loading for various AFCI fuel cycle scenarios. Improved separations efficiencies are shown to have continuing technical benefit in fuel cycles that recycle Am and Cm, but a substantial benefit can be achieved with modest separation efficiencies.

This evaluation was performed to provide information to scientists and decision makers to compare candidate geologic media for a repository (crystalline rock [granite], clay, salt, and deep borehole), and to provide input for the future evaluation of the trade-off between pre-emplacement surface storage time, waste package size, and repository footprint. This approach was selected in favor of the finite element solution typically used to analyze the temperature response because it allowed rapid comparison of a large number of alternative disposal options and design configurations. More than 100 combinations of waste form, geologic environment, repository design configuration, and surface storage times were analyzed and compared.},

	title = {Introduction to groundwater modeling},
	isbn = {978-0-12-734585-7},
	abstract = {The dramatic advances in the efficiency of digital computers during the past decade have provided hydrologists with a powerful tool for numerical modeling of groundwater systems. Introduction to Groundwater Modeling presents a broad, comprehensive overview of the fundamental concepts and applications of computerized groundwater modeling.The book covers both finite difference and finite element methods and includes practical sample programs that demonstrate theoretical points described in the text. Each chapter is followed by problems, notes, and references to additional information. This volume will be indispensable to students in introductory groundwater modeling courses as well as to groundwater professionals wishing to gain a complete introduction to this vital subject. Key Features* Systematic exposition of the basic ideas and results of Hilbert space theory and functional analysis* Great variety of applications that are not available in comparable books* Different approach to the Lebesgue integral, which makes the theory easier, more intuitive, and more accessible to undergraduate students},

Solutions, obtained by means of Laplace transforms, are given for different initial and boundary conditions. Some typical examples, furthermore, demonstrate the effects of the two rate terms on resulting chemical concentration distributions.},

The calculations presented here apply to the case in which a solute, uniformly distributed throughout the medium at the outset of the experiment, is displaced by a solvent which may itself contain some of the solute. Results are given in dimensionless form for (i) the instantaneous concentration of solute leaving the bed, and (ii) the average solute concentration in the bed at any instant. Various limiting cases are discussed.},
