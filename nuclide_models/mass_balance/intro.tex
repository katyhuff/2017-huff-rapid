The mass balance models selected to represent the physics of mass distribution 
within each component are selected from among four options. The Degradation Rate 
model and Mixed Cell model are control volumes that distribute contaminants 
between a liquid and a solid phase. These models calcuate a homogenous 
concentration profile throughout the volume and are therefore
zero-dimensional in space. The Lumped Parameter model and the One Dimensional 
Permeable Porous Medium model, however, calculate one dimensional concentration 
profiles to arrive at a mass distribution throughout the volume. 

These models are differentiated from one another by the physics that they 
capture as well as the detail and accuracy with which they capture it.  
Depending on the component being modeled, the user's available data, need for 
accuracy, and need for speed, some mass balance models will be more appropriate 
than others.
