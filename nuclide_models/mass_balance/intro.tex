\Cyder tracks the transport of disposed contaminant masses from the innermost 
component to the outermost far field component and calculates releases to the 
human biosphere (outside the outermost component) in order to assess 
containment performance. Accordingly, it is necessary to calculate a mass balance 
in each component. The four models implemented to assess mass balance are 
discussed in this section.

The mass balance models selected to represent the physics of mass distribution
within each component are selected from among four options. The Degradation Rate
model and Mixed Cell model are control volumes that distribute contaminants
between a liquid and a solid phase. These models calcuate a homogenous
concentration profile throughout the volume and are therefore
0-dimensional in space. The Lumped Parameter model and the One Dimensional
Permeable Porous Medium model, however, calculate one dimensional concentration
profiles to arrive at a mass distribution throughout the volume.

These models are differentiated from one another by the physics that they
capture as well as the detail and accuracy with which they capture it.
Depending on the component being modeled, available data, need for
accuracy, and need for speed, some mass balance models will be more appropriate
than others for certain simulations. This section will provide an overview of
these mathematical models and will provide guidance for their appropriate use.
