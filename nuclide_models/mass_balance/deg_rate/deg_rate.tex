\subsubsection{Degradation Rate Radionuclide Mass Balance Model}\label{sec:deg_rate}
Many barrier materials in a repository environment degrade over time.  The
Degradation Rate mass balance model is the simplest implemented model and is
most appropriate for rate based modeling of a degrading barrier volume.  The
Degradation Rate mass balance model does not attempt to model the physical
mechanisms responsible for this degradation. Rather, it generically captures
this behavior as a simple fractional degradation rate.  The fundamental concept
is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:deg_volumes}.

For a situation as in \Cyder and \Cyclus, with discrete time steps, the time
steps are assumed to be small enough to assume a constant rate of degradation over
the course of the time step.  The degraded volume, then, is a simple fraction,
$d$, of the total volume, $V_T$, such that

\begin{align}
V_T &= V_i + V_d
\label{deg_volumes}
\intertext{where}
V_d(t) &= d(t)V_T\nonumber\\
V_i(t) &= (1-d(t))V_T\nonumber\\
V_T &= \mbox{ total volume }[m^3]\nonumber\\
V_i(t) &= \mbox{ intact volume at time t }[m^3]\nonumber\\
V_d(t) &= \mbox{ degraded volume at time t }[m^3]\nonumber
\intertext{and}
d(t) &= \mbox{ the fraction that has been degraded by time t }[-]\nonumber\\
     &= \sum_{n=0}^{N}f_n\Delta t\nonumber\\
\intertext{where}
f_n &= \mbox{ the constant rate over a time step }[1/s]\nonumber\\
\Delta t &= \mbox{ the length of a time step }[s].\nonumber
\end{align}

In this model, all contaminants in the degraded fraction of the control volume
are available to adjacent components such that,

\begin{align}
m_{jk}(t_n) &= m_{j,d}(t_n)
\intertext{where}
m_{jk}(t_n) &= \mbox{ incoming mass from the inner boundary }[kg]\nonumber\\
m_{j,d} &= \mbox{ mass in degraded volume of cell j }[kg] \nonumber\\
t_n &= \mbox{ time }[s].\nonumber
\end{align}

The total contaminants $m_{j,d}(t_n)$, available in the degraded volume
at time $t_n$ are calculated based on mass flux from the
inner boundary, the updated mass in the degraded volume at the previous
time step, and the mass released by degradation during the
current time step. Specifically,

\begin{align}
m_{k,d}(t_n) &= m_{jk}(t_n) + m_{k,d}^*(t_{n-1}) + m_{k,i}^*(t_{n-1})f_n\Delta t
\label{deg_rate_source_cont}
\intertext{where}
m_{k,d}^*(t_{n-1}) &= \mbox{ mass in the degraded volume of k at the end of }t_{n-1}\mbox{ }[kg]\nonumber\\
m_{k,i}^*(t_{n-1}) &= \mbox{ mass in the intact volume of k at the end of }t_{n-1}\mbox{ }[kg]\nonumber\\
f_n&= \mbox{ degradation rate during the time step }t_n\mbox{ }[1/s]\nonumber\\
\Delta t &= t_n-t_{n-1}\mbox{ }[s].\nonumber
\end{align}

The concentration calculation results from the mass balance calculation in
\eqref{deg_rate_source_cont} to support parent components that utilize the
Dirichlet boundary condition.  For the degradation rate model, which
incorporates no diffusion or advection, the concentration, $C_j$ at $r_j$, the
boundary between cells $j$ and $k$, is the average concentration in degraded
volume,

\begin{align}
C_{d} &= \frac{m_{d}(t_n)}{V_{d}(t_n)} \label{deg_rate_conc}\\
&= \frac{\mbox{ solute mass in degraded fluid in cell j }}{\mbox{ degraded fluid volume in cell j}}.\nonumber
\end{align}
