\caption{In \Cyder, as in a canonical drift-tunnel repository, waste form 
        components (the innermost components) are contained by waste package components which 
        are, in turn, emplaced in a buffer component (the backfilled 
        emplacement tunnel into which waste packages are loaded). That buffer component 
        contains many other waste packages, spaced evenly in a horizontal grid. 
        The geosphere (the outermost component) occupies all space below the 
        repository surface and outside of the buffer components (emplacement 
        tunnels). The \Cyder repository layout has a depth ($\Delta z$) and 
        package spacing defined by the user input ($\Delta x$ within the drifts 
        and $\Delta y$ between drifts.)}
