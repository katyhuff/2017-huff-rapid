\subsubsection{Explicit, Advection-Dominated Mass Transfer}\label{sec:adv_mass_transfer}

Specified-concentration, or Dirichlet type, boundary conditions define
a specified species concentration on some section of the boundary of the
representative volume,

    \begin{align}
      C(\vec{r},t)\Big|_{\vec{r} \in \Gamma} &= C_0(t)
      \intertext{where}
      \vec{r} &= \mbox{ position vector }\nonumber\\
      \Gamma &= \mbox{ domain boundary }.\nonumber
    \end{align}

The right hand side of the Dirichlet boundary condition can be provided by any
mass balance model, $j$, at its external boundary, $r_j$, based on the
concentration profile it calculates (see Section \ref{sec:mass_balance}). The
resulting concentration profile depends on the mass balance model chosen to
represent that component,

\begin{align}
C(z,t_n)|_{z=r_j} &= \mbox{ fixed concentration in j at }r_j\mbox{ and }t_n [kg/m^3].\nonumber\\
                  &= \begin{cases}
                         \frac{m_{d}(t_n)}{V_{d}(t_n)}, & \mbox{Degradation Rate}\\
                         \frac{m_{df}(t_n)}{V_{df}(t_n)}, & \mbox{Mixed Cell}\\
                         C_{out}(t_n), & \mbox{Lumped Parameter}\\
                         C(r_j,t_n), & \mbox{One Dimensional PPM}.
                      \end{cases}
\end{align}

In the Degradation Rate and Mixed Cell models, the Dirichlet boundary condition can
be chosen to enforce an advective flux on the inner boundary. This choice is
appropriate when the user expects a primarily advective interface between two
components. The advective flux across the boundary between two components $j$
and $k$, relies on the fixed concentration Dirichlet boundary condition at the
interface, provided by the internal component, thus

\begin{align}
J_{adv}(t_n) &= \mbox{ potential advective flux at }t_n[kg/m^2/s]\nonumber\\
               &= \theta v C(z,t_n).
\end{align}

The resulting mass transfer into the component is, therefore,
\begin{align}
m_{jk}(t_n) &= A\Delta t \theta_k v C(z,t_n)|_{z=r_j}
\intertext{where}
A &= \mbox{ surface area normal to flow }[m^2]\nonumber\\
\Delta t &= \mbox{ length of the time step }[s].\nonumber
\end{align}

When mass transfer is dispersion-dominated, this model should not be used.
Instead, the dispersion-dominated model is more appropriate.
