\Cyder conducts radionuclide contaminant transport through a generic geologic 
repository concept to determine the 
contaminants expected to reach the environment. This key calculation 
informs repository performance assesment metrics related to containment and 
environmental impact.

To acheive this, \Cyder models engineered and natural containment barriers as 
distinct control volumes. These \emph{components} are arranged in a regular 
grid at a single vertical depth within a geologic component. Adjacent 
components share mass transfer interfaces. Mass transfer between them is based 
on the mass inventory and distribution within adjacent components. Mass 
inventory is a simple sum of in and out flows while mass distribution within 
the Component is determined by the dominant physics of the mass balance model 
selected for that volume.

In \Cyder, the mass transfer and mass balance solution follows an implicit 
\emph{time stepping algorithm}. The solution behavior is determined by selecting 
among \emph{mass transfer modes} at component boundaries and selecting among 
\emph{mass balance models} within the components. This section will describe 
the mathematics behind these three aspects of the \Cyder paradigm, beginning 
with the phases of the time stepping algorithm.
