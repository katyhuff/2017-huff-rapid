Radionuclide contaminant transport assessment in \Cyder determines the 
radionuclide contaminants expected to reach the far field. This key calculation 
informs repository performance assesment metrics related to containment and 
environmental impact.

The \Cyder model assesses performance by modeling 
engineered and natural containment barriers as distinct control volumes connected 
by mass transfer interfaces. These interfaces approximate mass transfer based on 
the mass inventory and distribution within adjacent 
control volumes. Mass inventory is a simple sum of in and out flows, 
and mass distribution within the control volume is determined by the dominant 
physics of the mass balance model selected for that volume.
