\Cyder conducts radionuclide contaminant transport to determine the 
contaminants expected to reach the environment. This key calculation 
informs repository performance assesment metrics related to containment and 
environmental impact.

To acheive this, \Cyder models engineered and natural 
containment barriers as distinct control volumes. These `Components' are 
connected by mass transfer interfaces that approximate mass transfer based on 
the mass inventory and distribution within adjacent Components. Mass inventory 
is a simple sum of in and out flows while mass distribution within the 
Component is determined by the dominant physics of the mass balance model selected 
for that volume.
