In the parametric sensitivity analysis discussed in section 
\ref{sec:solubility}, it was shown that for solubility limits below a certain 
threshold, the dose releases were directly proportional to the solubility 
limit, indicating that the radionuclide concentration saturated the groundwater 
up to the solubility limit near the waste form.  For solubility limits above 
the threshold, however, further increase to the limit had no effect on the peak 
dose. This demonstrates the situation in which the solubility limit is so high 
that even complete dissolution of the waste inventory into the pore water is 
insufficient to reach the solubility limit.

In Figures \ref{fig:SolSumFactor} and \ref{fig:SolSum}, it is clear that for 
solubility constants lower than a threshold, the transport regime is solubility 
limited and the relationship between peak annual dose and solubility limit is 
strong.  Above the threshold, the transport regime is inventory limited 
instead.
