\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:results}

In the present work, many numerical experiments successfully verified the \Cyder software library.
Multi-component simulations demonstrated expected transport behavior and
the successful collective interaction of the modular
components in a \Cyder repository. Single-parameter sensitivity analyses
demonstrated that physics captured by the \Cyder models compare favorably to
results reported in \cite{huff_key_2012} from a more detailed existing model,
the Clay \gls{GDSM}, developed by the \gls{UFD} Campaign within the
\gls{DOE} Office of Nuclear Energy \cite{clayton_generic_2011}.

In addition to these numerical experiments, a robust unit test suite was
deployed during development to verify \Cyder software implementation.

% The existence of this code enables dynamic analysis of repository performance
% during fuel cycle simulation.

This work has provided a flexible software library for rapid medium-fidelity
calculation of generic repository performance in the context of fuel cycle
analysis.  Capable of hydrologic contaminant transport and integration within a
fuel cycle simulation library, \Cyder is the first of its kind.

In this work, modeling methods for geologic radioactive waste disposal
performance analysis were described as was their implementation in the \Cyder
repository performance library. The application programming interface to this
software library is intentionally general, facilitating the incorporation of
the models presented here within external software tools.

\Cyder performance within the \Cyclus fuel cycle simulator and agreement
between Cyder and a more detailed stand-alone model were also demonstrated.
\Cyder methods make a strategic tradeoff between speed and fidelity, capturing
essential physics when computing back-end nuclear fuel cycle metrics. The
result is a library of medium-fidelity hydrologic contaminant transport models
within a disposal facility simulation framework appropriate for use in dynamic
nuclear fuel cycle simulators.

The \Cyder source code is freely available to interested researchers and
potential model developers \cite{huff_cyder_2013}.  In addition to the source
code and supporting publications, the \Cyder library is well commented and
produces clickable, browsable automated documentation with each build. That
documentation is also available online.

Finally, this work contributes to an expanding ecosystem of computational
models available for use with the \Cyclus fuel cycle simulator. This hydrologic
nuclide transport library, by virtue of its capability to modularly integrate
with the \Cyclus fuel cycle simulator has laid the foundation for integrated
disposal option analysis in the context of fuel cycle options.
