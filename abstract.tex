This work presents the hydrologic radionuclide transport methods implemented in 
\textsc{Cyder}, a software library enabling medium fidelity repository 
performace assessment in the \textsc{Cyclus} nuclear fuel cycle 
simulator.  The radionuclide contaminant transport framework and methods are 
described. The methods are then demonstrated to be sufficiently rapid for 
parametric studies in a nuclear fuel cycle simulator.
