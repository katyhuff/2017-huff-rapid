This work presents \textsc{Cyder}, a repository performance framework 
appropriate for parametric studies in a nuclear fuel cycle simulator.  Current 
nuclear fuel cycle simulators lack dynamic repository performance analysis due 
to the computational burden of high-fidelity hydrolgic contaminant transport 
models.  The \textsc{Cyder} radionuclide contaminant transport framework 
provides a modular simulation tool for dynamic repository performance analysis 
within fuel cycle simulation.  Within that framework, medium-fidelity 
hydrologic radionuclide transport models were developed to support assessment 
appropriate for fuel cycle simulation.  Modeling hundreds of waste packages in 
a geologic environment is enabled within this framework by a suite of four 
closed form models for advective, dispersive, coupled, and idealized 
contaminant transport.  A summary of the framework, an overview of the 
mathematical models, and several parametric demonstrations built on the 
framework are then presented.
