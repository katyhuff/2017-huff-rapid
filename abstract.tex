Repository performance metrics are a common basis of comparison between 
potential nuclear fuel cycles. 
Nuclear fuel cycle simulators tasked with the duty of making high-level 
comparisons of those fuel cycles are, however, lacking in robust repository 
performance analyses. 
This work presents the hydrologic radionuclide transport methods implemented in 
\textsc{Cyder}, a software library which adds medium fidelity repository 
performace assessment capability to the \textsc{Cyclus} fuel cycle simulator.
