\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Repository performance metrics provide an important basis for comparison among
p tential nuclear fuel cycles.
Additionally, nuclear fuel cycle and and nuclear waste disposal decisions are
technologically coupled through the characteristics of spent fuel which vary among fuel cycles and impact repository design and performance (i.e. \gls{SNF} volume, isotopic composition, mass, disposition, and other variables). 
For this reason, dynamic integration of a generic disposal model with a fuel 
cycle systems analysis framework is necessary to illuminate performance 
distinctions of candidate repository host media, designs, and engineering 
components in the context of fuel cycle options. 
However, the computational
burden of robust repository performance analysis has previously not been
compatible with fuel cycle simulation.
Therefore, current nuclear fuel cycle simulators
lack coupled repository performance analysis capabilities.

Most current tools treat the waste disposal
phase of fuel cycle analysis statically in post processing by reporting
values such as mass, volumes, radiotoxicity, or heat production of accumulated
\gls{SNF} and \gls{HLW}. Such tools
(e.g.,
\gls{NUWASTE} \cite{abkowitz_nuclear_2011},
\gls{DANESS} \cite{van_den_durpel_daness:_2006},
\gls{NFCSim} \cite{schneider_nfcsim_2004}, and
ORION \cite{gregg_orion_2011})
fail to address the dynamic impact of those waste streams on the performance of the
geologic disposal system \cite{wilson_comparing_2011}.  Two tools, \gls{COSI}
\cite{boucher_international_2010} and \gls{VISION} \cite{yacout_vision_2006,
wilson_comparing_2011, radel_repository_2007, boucher_international_2010},
dynamically perform heat based capacity calculations. 
However, those calculations are applicable only for specific
repository concepts and cannot inform sensitivity to alternate geologic disposal
system characteristics.
Since repository capacity and loading strategies are impacted by \gls{SNF} 
characteristics such as volume and composition, and since those may vary 
according to fuel cycle strategy and may over time in scenarios which 
include transitions between fuel cycles, a dynamic coupling between fuel cycle 
analysis and repository loading and performance more accurately captures reality.

This paper presents the \Cyder software library \cite{huff_cyder_2013} and its radionuclide
contaminant transport models, which were  developed to fill this capability gap.  To
enable dynamic analysis of waste metrics, \Cyder provides medium fidelity
models to conduct repository performance analysis on efficient timescales
appropriate for fuel cycle analyses. It has been implemented as a Facility
compatible with version 0.3 of the \Cyclus framework
\cite{wilson_cyclus:_2012}, but since it is compiled as a dynamically loadable 
shared object library with a well defined \gls{API}, it can also be used as a standalone library. An
overview of the \Cyder framework and mathematical descriptions of its
radionuclide transport models appear in Section \ref{sec:nuclide_models}.

The present work also verifies the hydrologic modeling capability in \Cyder 
through parametric simulations performed with \Cyder
within \Cyclus. Those results are presented in
Section \ref{sec:results} alongside comparable parametric simulations conducted
using a more detailed computational model, the Clay \gls{GDSM}. The Clay 
\gls{GDSM} was developed by the \gls{UFD} Campaign within the \gls{DOE} Office 
of Nuclear Energy \cite{clayton_generic_2011} and relies on the GoldSim 
simulation environment \cite{golder_associates_goldsim_2010-1} and its 
contaminant transport module \cite{golder_associates_goldsim_2010-1}.
