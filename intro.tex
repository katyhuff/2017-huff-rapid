\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Repository performance metrics provide an important basis for comparison among 
potential nuclear fuel cycles. However, current nuclear fuel cycle simulators 
lack coupled repository performance analysis capabilities.  The computational 
burden of robust repository performance analysis has previously not been 
compatible with fuel cycle simulation.

The \Cyder softwrae library and its radionuclide contaminant transport models 
were  developed to fill this capability gap \cite{huff_cyder_2013}. For 
compatibility with fuel cycle simulators, \Cyder  conducts repository 
performance analysis at a level of fidelity appropriate for fuel cycle 
analyses.
