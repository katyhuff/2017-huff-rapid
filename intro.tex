\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Repository performance metrics provide an important basis for comparison among 
potential nuclear fuel cycles. However, current nuclear fuel cycle simulators 
lack coupled repository performance analysis capabilities. 

The computational burden of robust repository performance 
analysis has previously not been compatible with fuel cycle simulation.

The \Cyder code and its radionuclide contaminant transport models were  
developed to fill this capability gap. For compatibility with fuel cycle 
simulators, \Cyder  conducts repository performance 
analysis at a level of fidelity appropriate for fuel cycle analyses.
